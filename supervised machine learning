Supervised machine learning methods

What are supervised learning methods (short recap)
Supervised machine learning methods have a clear goal in mind and the data is labeled. For example, we want to know the difference between
flat and structured surfaces, so we send the data in the model with these labels defined. This technique is mainly used to predict future
values based on the given data.




Lastly, some things to keep in mind:
1. We need to split the data in two sets: a training set and a test set (80/20 ratio). That is necessary because the data with which you
train the data will have a lower prediction error than new data. Of course, if we choose to use an existing model, all the data will be
test data.
