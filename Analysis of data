Summary of paper "Surface topography enhances differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells towards osteogenic and adipogenic lineages" (Abagnale, et al., 2015)

In this study, in vitro mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) differentiation was compared on a variety of groove/ridge structures.
Different nano- and micro-patterns were generated in polyimide using reactive ion etching or multi beam laser interference.
The structures affected cell spreading and orientation of human MSCs, which was also reflected in focal adhesions morphology and size.
Migration happened parallel to the nano-patterns. Surface patterns clearly enhance differentiation of MSCs towards specific lineages:
15 micrometer ridged increased adipogenic differentiation whereas 2 micrometer ridged enhanced osteogenic differentiation.
Nano-patterns with a perodicity of 650 nm increased differentiation in both osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. 
In absence of differentiation media surfuce structure did neither induce differentiation, nor lineage-specific gene expression changes.
Results provide insight on how structuring of tailored implant interfaces do not induce differentiation per se, but support directed differentiation.

Cells can sense substrate elasticity, mechanical stimuli from the ECM, cell-to-cell interactions and also surface patterns
ranging from 10 nanometer to 100 micrometer. This recognition is mostly mediated by integrin receptors. Tailored biomaterials
can mimic the topography of the "stem cell niche", but those landscapes are very complex. The topography is therefore changed
and tested with one paramater at a time in order to determine its impact on cellular functions. Grooved patterns are chosen because
1. width of grooves and ridged can be systematically modified
2. orientation of cells allong these structures can readily be observed
3. Such structures may reflect the fibrillar organization of ECM of callagen fibrils
