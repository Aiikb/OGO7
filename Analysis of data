Summary of paper "Surface topography enhances differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells towards osteogenic and adipogenic lineages" (Abagnale, et al., 2015)

In this study, in vitro mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) differentiation was compared on a variety of groove/ridge structures.
Different nano- and micro-patterns were generated in polyimide using reactive ion etching or multi beam laser interference.
The structures affected cell spreading and orientation of human MSCs, which was also reflected in focal adhesions morphology and size.
Migration happened parallel to the nano-patterns. Surface patterns clearly enhance differentiation of MSCs towards specific lineages:
15 micrometer ridged increased adipogenic differentiation whereas 2 micrometer ridged enhanced osteogenic differentiation.
Nano-patterns with a perodicity of 650 nm increased differentiation in both osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. 
In absence of differentiation media surfuce structure did neither induce differentiation, nor lineage-specific gene expression changes.
Results provide insight on how structuring of tailored implant interfaces do not induce differentiation per se, but support directed differentiation.
