UnpackCell: 
Opens cell files, normalises data, filters based on variance (percentile) and writes to a text file.

Dataprep: 
Reads datamatrix from text file into a dataframe, uses clustering to find outliers, creates a dataframe with sample-traits, optionally filters dataset based on traits and visualises samples. Writes to Rdata file.
Outliers: The sample tree of the var95_all dataset does not show any obvious outliers, the tree of a dataset with var99 shows two samples which split high but not extremely so. See folder Plots.

Network:
Reads dataset and sampletraits dataframes from Rdata file, plots scale-free topology fit index and mean connectivity for a range of soft-thresholding powers, creates unsigned network with chosen soft-thresholding power and visualises network and modules. Writes to Rdata file.
Soft-thresholding power: This is a value used to power the correlation of the genes to that threshold. To choose this you look at the scale-free topology fit index, when this number reaches 0.9 the network is 'scale-free'. For the var95_all dataset the number does not go above 0.8 for powers up to 20, this means that there is probably a strong driver in the data, in this case, the different timescales. Because this is a trait we want to investigate, the data is not split and a power of 6 is chosen. see point 6: https://horvath.genetics.ucla.edu/html/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/faq.html

Analysis:
Reads dataset and sampletraits dataframes and network info from Rdata file, calculates and plots module-trait correlation in a heatmap, calculates gene-module membership and gene-trait significance and creates a scatterplot with linear regression line and correlation of chosen module membership and trait-gene significance. Links transcript ids to gene names, creates summary of gene and module info and writes to csv file.
